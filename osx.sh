This script will install the Pragmatic Bookshelf m13 toolset under the directory

    $HOME/.pragprog/m13

It will also offer to install a global alias to the main \`m13\` command, making
it more convenient to run the tools on your projects.

Just because you're right to be nervous, we'll show you each command before
we run it, giving you the chance to veto it.

Here come the first one…

The following command will install a link to the m13 command
into your \$PATH, which makes it more convenient. If you say
"N", you will need to run it using the full path:

    ~/.pragprog/m13/bin/m13 «options»

maybe_run "$M13/bin/m13 install-into-path"
